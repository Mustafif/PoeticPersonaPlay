\paragraph{Author's Note:\\}
\par I honestly don't know how long it took me to get the poems and really actually complete this collection, it has almost been a year 
and this all started actually as a birthday present. This is really late but Happy Birthday Grace, Turbulent Troubles is really dedicated to you, I really wouldn't be so inspired to write poems if it wasn't for you, I am forever grateful. Poems have been a way I really was able to express my feelings in words, and it really got me to understand myself as well. With mental health being a big theme in this collection, hence the title Turbulent Troubles which is a metaphor for pretty much a breakdown. This collection was planned to be around 30 to 40 poems, I'm guessing around 20 or so poems weren't even considered. These are all originally written, with some lines being inspired from different poems or songs, but this collection it talks about sensitive topics, and I use sexual references and explicit language to address them. A big topic in this is suicide which we all know is a serious topic, and it's talked a lot in my mental health poems because it's a problem I faced when I was in grief, and I really took chances to talk about the thoughts that one may have, and really to not give into them and really try to tell people hey there's a positive, everything will be alright. My first couple poems actually landed me into having to talk to social workers, and I'll be honest it's not for everyone, it didn't help me, my mom is who really got me out of that shit, and sometimes I really laugh at how stupid I was to think about those stuff, and well I won't say anymore, I hope you enjoy Turbulent Troubles!

\section{Turbulent Troubles}
I am an Imperfectionist\\
I am a failure of love\\ 
A lonely dove that struggles to fly\\
I am the devils to my sins\\ 
And that Satan is the hell in me\\ 
With a cloudy mind\\ 
I can’t see clearly\\ 
I lose control\\
My heart being stolen, I’m losing control\\
Winds striking me, this shit be making me limping\\ 
I’m going through turbulent troubles\\
I fumble in the sky because I can no longer fly\\ 
I can’t soar through the skies anymore\\
I can barely lift off the ground\\
I sound like a broken plane crashing\\
You’ll hear my stories through my Black box\\ 
A story of logical paradox\\ 
My mind rambling, as they attempt to extinguish my fire\\ 
I’m tired of writing this shit\\
Parts and parts of the same story\\
One telling one more secret\\ 
Because I’m a pussy to say them all\\
I can’t say them all, or else I’ll fall in a pit of regret\\
I can’t reset my life\\ 
To end my agonizing strife\\
Or end it with my own knife\\ 
That was something I wrote in my first poem\\ 
It was a poem I never looked back at\\
I liked I’m okay\\ 
And the second part made it a series\\
A poem doing magic for me\\
My own fairy\\ 
But I can summarize it in four words\\
I am never okay\\
Today might be the day\\
Today might be tomorrow’s promise\\ 
My Black box is still working\\
But I’m not\\
So, hear out my story of how I got to this point\\
So, before I leave\\
Here out my last words\\ 
I ………forgot 
\newpage

\section{Poet's Poem}
I started writing when I was sad\\
Get an idea whenever I felt bad\\
I never really valued myself\\ 
On behalf of me I dedicate poems to those who showed me my value\\ 
It was a clue left for me\\ 
So, I can see\\
That there’s more to me\\ 
And that I have a dream, I can believe\\ 
I write poems\\ 
Give my hand freedom to write\\ 
Endings clashing as my thoughts come to sight\\ 
I want to show you my talent\\ 
So, as you read on, I’ll leave you silent\\ 
I couldn’t believe I am who I am\\ 
This sleeve this world puts on me makes me want to cry\\
To be deceived, as feelings are twirled, I see the fakes that come at me\\ 
He who is the one wouldn’t love if loving was the key to money\\
As solidarity mental confinement can leave a man begging on his knees\\ 
Please oh god please as he begs for mercy, but what he can’t see\\ 
Was the Lord and Savior he believed in made Him blind\\ 
That towards all his kindness, god never existed\\ 
He was always free, but this pain fell to his legs\\ 
As when he begs it’s for nothing but comfort\\
That kind of sorts kept fucking with his mind\\ 
It was a sign to him\\
That a poet’s poem can mean a lot, but for you to listen\\
Please get in line, fasten your seat belts because the story has only started

\section{Pac in the Head}
You got Pac in your head and you can't lie 
\\Thinking of thug life in your own life 
\\Got weed in your system 
\\Because you don't know what you want 
\\But need something in your feed to impress other guys 
\\A sorry sucker confuzzled in his context 
\\Trying to be flawless with his every flaw 
\\You ain't Beyonce bitch ha ha 
\\Because he ain't got nothing to lose but losing 
\\He's refusing to the confusing because he's losing it 
\\As you are because rhyming is enjoying the chime pac was writing 
\\Because death in the streets were adding up
\\But police don't know how to add
\\But subtract the addicts they claimed them all 
\\Heartz of Men be dying 
\\Making Crips into blood and making the Bloods cripple 
\\Until they ended up uniting 
\\So don't try to act like the shining knight in armour 
\\Because you're just a whore just asking to be fucked
\\What?
\\You can't have a rap without being offended, so were you?
\\An old sap is still better than the new-gen 
\\Because they're just genes going backwards
\\Motherfuckers are acting wild going into their primal form
\\Millennial moms rather be calling than caring about their brat shit 
\\We have guys who become jocks who don't where to put their cocks
\\Cock up a gun to shoot the future rapists
\\Before therapists work overclock to deal with trauma 
\\Americans say it's all gods plan because they don't have any plan on doing shit 
\\So let's have the hopeless slit until there is no wrist left 
\\Claim all the blacks are committing theft 
\\Pac is in people's head 
\\Police is trying to stop all of this shit 
\\Who would've knew you would get shot with lead 
\\Because you were complaining you were being treated like shit
\\Get a divorce from the law enforcement 
\\Being funded is a privilege they deserve to lose
\\Don't say the whose or integrity in someone's shoes 
\\White people act like they know our trouble 
\\Putting on Instagram about races troubles 
\\What the fuck racism is 
\\It's a cycle we've been being fucked with throughout history
\\The minorities are asking for all eyez on me 
\\But the white supporters are getting the eyez 
\\The truth is, they don't know how we feel 
\\They don't have Pac in their head

\section{Waste}
I'm in mental confinement
\\I can't breathe
\\I'm in mental confinement
\\Anxiety has taken over me
\\Emotions spiralling
\\My thoughts are going crazy
\\Chatting with the other
\\They're going talk talk talk
\\What the fuck am I to do
\\I'm a fool to care about you
\\Wasted emotions, to fuck with you
\\I want to say that so bad
\\But I can't
\\Society is giving me anxiety
\\From expectations
\\To logical stupidity
\\Am I the only one who thinks clearly
\\Ha you thinking clearly
\\Who said that
\\You did
\\No I didn't
\\Yes you did
\\Thoughts speaking to each other
\\Consciousness is making me worried about going unconscious
\\I have to be cautious or else it'll come
\\Who'll come?
\\Suicide! I counter life goals
\\Breathe in carbon monoxide, hang yourself and let your body rot
\\What the fuck?
\\Didn't I, I don't know get rid of you
\\You're in mental confinement
\\I'm in the deepest hole in your mind
\\A black hole sucking out your happiness
\\You know you're not okay
\\Today may be your last today
\\To see if god exists
\\That bastard....
\\Would you like me to help you talk to him
\\Make him apologize
\\And fucking talk
\\No shut the fuck up
\\Wasted feelings you are only a scrap of my mind
\\A contaminate
\\These thoughts are nothing but a plague
\\But I'm immune
\\I took several doses of you
\\So let me spit, kick and fucking get rid of you
\\You'll stay in mental confinement
\\Where you goddamn belong
\\You sick thought
\\And your emotions were never wasted
\\I wish I could say sorry
\\But you wouldn't know what I was talking about
\\I wish I can be honest to you when I'm angry at you
\\But ill keep these thoughts in confinement
\\I'm tired wasting my time being angry at you

\newpage

\section{Meaningless Life}
No definition 
\\An empty space
\\Cased in a useless person who the fuck am I? 
\\Am I a useless fucking shit? 
\\A faggot ready to die 
\\Maggots in my head 
\\I’m already 6 ft down the ground 
\\A bastard in the making 
\\Satan is my new best friend 
\\The end of a meaning 
\\A period in a sentence 
\\I sentence myself to death 
\\Kill me 
\\See me bleed, maybe the pain will wake me 
\\I can handle a shake in my life 
\\Maybe I can finally have a girl love me 
\\Have someone care about me 
\\Please 
%
\\\\Give me meaning 
\\A life with no definition 
\\I only run in bad situations
\\Put me in a cage 
\\A bitch in bars 
\\Stars don’t even want to see me at night 
\\I have no one to fight with except myself 
\\Mental confinement 
\\I think I may be schizophrenic
\\People tell me my friends don’t exist
\\A broken disk 
\\Something that can’t be fixed 
\\I feel sick
\\A kick in the dick
\\Fuck, this is a bitch 
\\Life has no meaning
\\Until it does has something to define it 
\\That’s the shit

\newpage 

\section{I'm Okay}
Honesty isn’t the easiest thing 
\\Keeping a secret is easier 
\\But all the kept emotions sting 
\\It’s nice to know people are there for you
\\But you don’t want to worry them 
\\So, you tell them you’re fine too
\\I hate seeing kids sigh 
\\No kid deserves to be sad 
\\So, don’t mind me, keep an eye
\\My acquisition may be perplexing 
\\And I may be a bit confusing 
\\So, avoid making it complex 
\\I may have a bad temper at times 
\\I may tell you you’re wrong 
\\So sorry for my resolution climb 
\\I want to tell you I’m okay 
\\But I can’t lie 
\\Please don’t cry
\\For it isn’t my last today

\newpage

\section{Individual}
I'm an individual
\\An outlier in a graph
\\A unique one in the pack
\\The puzzle piece that doesn't fit with the rest
\\I'm an individual
\\I have my own thoughts
\\A free mind and conscious
\\I'm cautious of my actions
\\I am fully aware of my decisions
\\Hesitant to seem different
\\Hell if you don't lift that finger
\\Maybe you'll pull the trigger
\\I mean I figure if I'm my own person
\\I get more choices out my actions
\\If I'm my own person
\\I don't need to rely on others
\\I go on my own pace
\\And if I face troubles out of my scope
\\I know I got others at my side
\\Because being your own person
\\Lets you make friends out of your decision
\\The opposition is
\\Being my own person
\\I make myself happy
\\My feelings don't rely on others
\\Or else
\\I'd be pretty depressed
\\Stressed to make you happy
\\Let me kiss your feet, I beg you be happy
\\For me
\\No!
\\Be happy with me
\\See colours in the sky with me
\\Not because of me not seeing clearly
\\I need myself to be happy
\\Before I expect making someone else happy
\\Now sadly my poem is soon to be ending
\\But before I go
\\Just be your own individual already

\section{Love Shit}
Another part of a tragic story 
\\With my success I’ll be single until forty 
\\Because I’m done with this fucking love shit 
\\Tisk Tisk Tisk poor pity feel bad 
\\Rejection is just an objection for me 
\\It’s sad I know but fuck it I know how shitty it is
\\Too close for another member
\\My emotions are trembling 
\\Rambling about this love shit 
\\I already told you I was done writing this 
\\So why am I here 
\\Because I don’t know who to talk to 
\\I don’t know what to say to friends
\\I don’t want to worry her about my worries 
\\Fuck it can I love this love crap 
\\Wrap it up, crumble it and throw it away
\\She’s not like her 
\\I can’t think of her as a sister
\\I can’t only few can reach that level of love
\\Hell, I don’t even know 
\\She’s not my bro
\\She’s my good friend 
\\Fuck I’m just convincing myself 
\\I’ll write books on shelves to convince me 
\\I’m so confused
\\I’m the Imperfectionist 
\\I’m not a perfectionist 
\\Flaws are too messed up
\\Pass me a glass
\\So, I can forget this mess
\\She won’t love me
\\I know
\\I don’t need to ask
\\Fuck, why do I even try anymore
\\Four would’ve been too much
\\My fragile heart can’t take such damage
\\Paranoia is always in me 
\\Chasing me as anxiety catches up 
\\Trauma is slowing me down
\\Memories appear…FUCK OFF!!!
\\Love really does trigger my flaws
\\My wrongs can’t make a right
\\So, fuck it
\\I’ll wait for tomorrow’s promise 
\\So, goodnight 

\newpage

\section{Love Haiku}
Did I not love you?
\\Was I misguided to you?
\\No, just a big fool...

\section{Picture This}
Picture this 
\\Us being together 
\\Beloved 
\\Happy 
\\I would be there for you
\\As you would be for me
\\If I need support 
\\I had you 
\\I tried to picture it 
\\I tried
\\But I lost the footage 
\\Just like how I lost interest in you


\newpage
\section{Love}
I fell in love with you 
\\Before I even knew
\\\\I guess in my life when you came 
\\I couldn’t stop smiling 
\\My heart dialing numbers of how much time I smiled 
\\Sorry I’m too tired now to say how much you matter to me 
\\You helped me when I was at my lowest point 
\\I am forever thankful, but I need you again
\\My mind can’t think properly
\\Hopping through ideas, my insanity is coming back
\\I lack the strength to deal with it, and I need your help again
\\But I’m afraid to ask
\\\\I guess in my life when you came 
\\I started to develop feelings 
\\I felt insane at the time for first finding you cute 
\\It does suit you though 
\\But you’ll always be my bro
\\\\I don’t like someone because of looks 
\\I like you and the personality that makes you up
\\Let me tell you how I feel making chapters in books 
\\As I kept reading, from rejections and failures I was missing something
\\What was I fucking missing? 
\\We were close so…what’s wrong?
\\I had noticed for how long my feelings were happening 
\\I was missing one fact
\\I was in love, I thought I liked her but no
\\Love was my foe, but…
\\\\I couldn’t stop to notice your beautiful smile 
\\As it puts happiness in the same aisle
\\\\All I wish is someone’s happiness
\\I hate seeing you sad
\\Fuck it, whoever hurt you will have to deal with me 
\\Don’t worry just don’t be hopeless
\\Because if you do, then who do I turn to?
\\\\With a wonderful voice 
\\And a beautiful personality 
\\Giving my heart a choice 
\\I sometimes feel I’m not in reality
\\Living an illusion
\\I couldn’t face reality; I couldn’t wake up
\\Depression kept me down, I needed you to help me get up
\\Fuck! Did you really insult me?
\\No, you didn’t, then why am I told you did?
\\My mind making false ideas, please…please prove me wrong 
\\\\At this time I may be shy 
\\But at least I say hi
\\\\I can’t put this in words 
\\I struggle in my mind to get this right 
\\But I want to say I love you 
\\I really do 
\\Though love is a strong word, but
\\It’s the only word I ever thought when I met you
\\Thank you

\newpage

\section{Older}
I'm getting older
\\Becoming more maturer
\\Starting to follow ideas of my own
\\I'm becoming more independent
\\I understand who I am
\\Not going through an identity crisis no more
\\I tend to swear
\\Like why is that bitch ass fucker so stupid
\\Like stay inside fool
\\Today's not the day for an adventure
\\I get off-topic
\\My brain goes through so much options
\\it's hard to make a decision
\\I'm hesitant to say the truth
\\It's like getting slit through the throat
\\Or on the wrist
\\If you're getting my drift
\\We might've been on the same boat
\\I'm not depressed, I'm bored
\\Mental health is nothing but a string
\\Watch out for it, or you'll trip
\\Hit the floor
\\And crack your head
\\Maybe even break your knee
\\But instead why didn't you slow down
\\Did anxiety get back in your head
\\That bastard can't even shut up
\\Voices and Choices
\\Shut the fuck up!
\\I don't want to listen to you anymore
\\You're a whore
\\You're the only purpose making me go crazy
\\I'm too lazy to argue
\\Decisions is becoming hazy
\\Was I going crazy, I'm forgetting
\\I'm letting my setting change
\\I'm in a cage, a mental confinement
\\Wasted emotions and deserted relationships
\\Remember that person? What a faggot
\\My voices are nagging
\\Is this what it means to grow older
\\More problems, less solutions
\\Fuck it I don't even know if this is a situation
\\Forgetting, letting myself rip apart
\\Self-isolation isn't a commotion
\\I want to be alone
\\So I can hone into these thoughts
\\How did I get this off-topic
\\My mind went everywhere
\\But I don't bother calling anxiety a problem
\\It's sometimes a solution
\\Suicide wasn't a problem or sickness to me
\\It was a lesson, one to teach me about me
\\Yes I grow older
\\Yes more problems arise
\\But instead of ignoring it
\\Give it a high five and get to know it
\\Who knows it might know you more than you
\\Don't find a solution to a problem
\\Find a problem to the solution
\\Now come on lets do shit
\\And get over that ridiculous skit 


\newpage 
\section{Illusions}
I'm sick of this illusion
\\Confused by love, what do I even do
\\Confucius give me an answer dammit
\\Tell me what I'm supposed to do
\\I'm a fool for loving her
\\But I'm a bigger fool for thinking she did
\\A leach sucking out my happiness
\\My sadness is nothing but heartbreak
\\So give me a break
\\Before I break
\\Can you at least ask you this one question?
\\Why is this illusion still stuck on me
\\When I keep tugging it out
\\Now don't fuck with me
\\Love isn't necessary to me
\\But why do I make it such a need?
\\Please tell me


\newpage 
\section{Intelligence}
A foul word
\\A spot to spit on
\\Mind your tongue when you speak of this word
\\You better regret saying it
\\A shit on the ground, why won't someone clean it up
\\Intelligence, a word fuelled by ego
\\A logo tattooed on to your mind
\\Oh my god I'm so intelligent
\\I know so much
\\Shut the fuck up no you don't
\\Knowledge is overrated
\\We don't know shit
\\Hell we may have scrapped one percent of it
\\So lets be punctuate about this
\\Can you pronounce you don't know everything
\\Can you say you know nothing
\\Can you
\\Because if you can't you're the idiot here
\\You're not intelligent
\\You're fucking egotistic
\\So get rid of that and say I'm stupid
\\I don't know shit
\\Ah why you so negative, why do you hate it
\\When people expect the plate I served once
\\They want another ounce of something new
\\They expected me to know everything
\\Pressure and stress getting me into distress
\\I confess I don't know it all
\\Don't make me fall into a pit of treating me like shit
\\But I should know that I don't know everything that I think I do
\\To avoid an ego may be a new goal
\\Feeling whole I can comfortably say
\\I'm not intelligent because I'm a know it all
\\I'm intelligent because I know I don't know shit
\\The nice thing about that is
\\You get to keep searching for answers for it


\newpage
\section{I'm Okay Pt 2}
Tomorrow should be better than today
\\What bullshit! I wish in one of them I was okay…
\\Don’t worry man it’ll be better than tomorrow 
\\\\Say that to my ever-lasting sorrow
\\My past couldn’t cause me enough pain 
\\Mental whiplashes tainting memories 
\\This mind will torture me until I go insane 
\\I can’t forget having dreams of not having enough slits to fit 
\\\\Or how the bleeding couldn’t be satisfied by a first aid kit 
\\I wanted attention 
\\But wanted to be ignored 
\\So please hurt me again
\\Why not if I’m bored 
\\Fucking whore 
\\I said 
\\“I want to tell you I’m okay 
\\But I can’t lie 
\\So, all I’ll say is I won’t decay 
\\Because who know when’s my last today”
\\\\When I wanted to be shot in the head
\\I’m a genius 
\\I read about Confucius 
\\But I wasn’t fucking smart 
\\Too much of a dumb ass to get my heart constantly broken
\\Rejections having stolen my love, I had to lock it 
\\For the safety for everyone, it can’t be unlocked
\\\\For if it does, we are all fucked, and hell will break loose!
\\I had to learn I can never be okay 
\\\\A fact I must obey
\\I die when people care about me 
\\Do they see something I don’t? 
\\I just can’t see why? 
\\Please don’t make me cry, I just want to hide with my emotions 
\\But then happy, caring memories come upon me 
\\\\Fucking cringe memories killing me 
\\My life is a bitch 
\\But having friends are like stitches 
\\They help fix you up when you’re in pain 
\\They help me stay sane 
\\But still…I complain
\\I flaw in my personality that is a permanent stain
\\I only give my friend the key 
\\To unlock the lock, and see the real me 
\\They accept me, it’s hard to believe 
\\But I do care for them
\\I feel condemned for my previous sins 
\\So, don’t worry about me 
\\Help those who need it more 
\\So, they can adore what I see
\\But before I leave 
\\Let me say
\\\textit{“I want to tell you I’m Okay
\\But I can’t lie 
\\I won’t always be fine 
\\Don’t worry I won’t go away
\\Until it’ s my last today”}

\newpage 
\section{Love Pt 2}

I don’t believe in love at first sight 
\\\\I don’t think it's totally right 
\\Yes, it's true I have loved somebody
\\\\And my love isn’t totally done 
\\But it isn’t the love you are thinking 
\\I realized I had two choices, 
\\I did love her romantically, 
\\\\But that’s not what’s happening 
\\Love has so many definitions 
\\\\And so many questions 
\\Like out of so many people why did I decide to love her
\\I know for sure it might be because of the positivity 
\\With all the negativity I was going through I needed some light 
\\A hope so bright that depression can go to fucking hell
\\And stop asking so much fucking questions 
\\\\Now I know this sounds more like a confession, it probably is 
\\With my blind eye I couldn’t see
\\That my feelings were developing at a rapid speed 
\\That my mind made love a need, a need for my empty heart
\\I’m starving…
\\But for starters I wanted to be there for her as a friend
\\So, our relationship wouldn’t end 
\\I already had loss so many…
\\Because of that backstabbing bitch
\\This one meant too much to me 
\\It was so easy to say, but so hard to do
\\Who would’ve known how much pain it brought?
\\It was a fucking bitch
\\I thought I could’ve just left 
\\But loneliness is it's own cancer spreading throughout me 
\\I couldn’t breathe from the anxiety it gave me
\\The only one who could save me was me 
\\I contemplated, and I figured…
\\That if my feelings were used to help her
\\The emotion called love allowed me to love her as a sister

\newpage 
\section{Beautiful Women}
Beauty has become such a standard 
\\A hazard to be cautious about
\\Arguments, fights all about what? Beauty?
\\You're ugly shut the fuck up!
\\Shouting and cursing everywhere around
\\Holy shit can everyone stop! Just let me think
\\What the hell is beauty? 
\\Is it really about looks or personality? 
\\A social construct made by society 
\\Beauty is found in all cultures
\\A word enslaving other’s mind 
\\Can we make a free meaning of it? 
\\I find that everyone is beautiful 
\\Some more than others 
\\I'm just joking 
\\A guy may be asked what is beautiful about a woman
\\May I comment? 
\\When I call a woman beautiful, I mean it, no bullshit 
\\Inside and out, the personality that makes you up and the person you are 
\\I’m not calling you more or less beautiful than someone else 
\\When I call you beautiful, you are the most beautiful person that’s like you
\\May I remind you
\\The only person that I’ve met that’s like you
\\Is you

\newpage 
\section{Soul}
Turbulent problems 
\\Falling in the air with no parachute 
\\As I fall, I can’t stop thinking how cute your smile was
\\Because I loved you, I hesitated
\\Because I hesitated, I never told you how much you meant
\\Well here it is 
\\When I first met you, my soul saw you
\\It kind of went oh there you are 
\\I’ve been looking for you
\\But I can’t fucking speak
\\Information is being leaked
\\Exposed on the down-low 
\\Dying doesn't destroy my love 
\\I was only dreaming that I told you
\\A fool for freaking out 
\\I avoid love because it hurts me
\\I want my feelings for you to leave me 
\\But the only thing I see 
\\Is my soul will always love you

\newpage 
\section{Love Pt 3}
Love is something that my mind thinks of 
\\Something I want to cover up or reciprocate
\\I hate it so much
\\The rejection from a bunch of girls stings 
\\This thing really hurts me 
\\I want it to leave me be 
\\I don’t want it to be the key of my life 
\\I’ll cut it with my knife 
\\Like how it chopped my heart 
\\That’s the start of my rant 
\\I can’t stop complaining 
\\\\Haining it's existence to me 
\\But Mustafif you've loved people?
\\Did I really say that?
\\In fact, you did 
\\I kid you not I couldn’t mean it 
\\Mustafif stop the bullshit 
\\Okay I loved and it hurts the fuck out of me
\\I want to see the person happy but is it goddamn worth it
\\In fact, it is 
\\This will make me go crazy
\\Lately you seem to need love 
\\To cover up your fears 
\\The tears I shed for love I hate it so goddamn bad
\\It cripples me 
\\Don’t forget why you love her
\\For happiness and the amount, you care about her 
\\Sure, it hurts 
\\But for her, the pain didn’t hurt a bit

\newpage 
\section{Love in the Petal}
Love is like a rose
\\It poses no threats
\\A pure beauty in first sight 
\\One wrong move on it and it hurts
\\A sort of refreshing reminder of the pain you will feel
\\As it can steal your happiness
\\My hand is bleeding but still I smile
\\Love is a feeling I either disregard or cherish
\\Stupidity is my consistency I think I may be retarded
\\I never would’ve learned love if it wasn’t for a cherry blossom
\\My thoughts were tossing me around
\\It all stopped and talked about cherry blossoms
\\This flower might have hurt me, and it reminded me of a rose
\\For those petals  were like thorns that hurt me, 
\\And made me realize what the blossom meant to me 
\\I loved this cherry blossom
\\But as awesome as it sounds\dots
\\I wasn’t happy when I found out 
\\How could I love it? 
\\Is this shit real 
\\Do I really love her? 
\\I mean do I love this cherry blossom 
\\The answer was yes 
\\I loved it deep down in my heart 
\\Those thorns of a rose pricked me to realize my mistakes
\\It had taken me a year to understand my feelings
\\It was more than a blessing to meet this cherry blossom 
\\But this love I had for it wasn’t something I ever felt before 
\\I....I...I finally love someone as a sister
\\I did it something I always thought wasn’t possible 
\\It wasn’t something linear to me 
\\I wasn’t tangent to it I thought it’d be undefined till I’m 90
\\My hands are bleeding but it's fine 
\\They have already started to heal
\\Just how my wrists have 
\\So, thank you cherry blossom for everything 
\\You will always be that cute girl I fell in love with 
\\The person who turned my world into colours

\section{I'm Okay Pt 3}
I wish people would stop caring about me
\\I'm fine
\\Ask that kid
\\He sighs, he frowns look at him
\\He needs more help than I
\\I'm telling you I rather care about that kid than me
\\Please see him, he's crying
\\He broke down, he needs to be repaired
\\I wish you cared to not help me
\\Let me keep myself hidden
\\Yes I know keeping secrets hurts
\\Like thousands of stings on my back
\\Hurting like heck, pricking me at a time
\\Listen to this chime
\\Heed the words in my rhyme
\\Yes visions scared me
\\Nightmares of death killed me
\\Will I die from my own knife?
\\Filled me with horrors
\\Not enough slits to play tick tack toes...
\\On my wrists before I fainted....
\\A whore in my mind fucking me
\\A victim of the prostitution of mind fuckness
\\Suicide is painless
\\Careless of others
\\Does my life have value
\\I salute you for trying but this is a fight between myself and I
\\As i figure myself out help that boy out goddammit
\\What do you mean he just keeps saying these four lines
\\I listen to a bit of it
\\"I want to.....for it isn't my last..."
\\Today, today is the present we are gifted with
\\A moment to reflect on the past
\\And plan for the future
\\Tomorrow will soon be today of the past
\\At last I go to the boy, if no one is going to help him i may as well
\\I ask are you okay
\\You tell me?
\\I'm confused
\\Perplexed by this complex puzzle
\\This boy he's...he's my inner self
\\My weakness
\\The boy crying for help
\\For he kept crying because I was refusing people to see my weakness
\\Asking them to..help me
\\When not wanting it
\\I must say
\\I want to tell you I'm okay
\\But I can't lie
\\Please don't cry
\\For it isn't my last today

\section{Turbulence Rewrite}
Emotions has become a commotion
\\As we hurl through the worst
\\Why don't we talk about grief
\\As we all try to swallow our pride and dignity
\\We all don't prepare to crash
\\All become ashes on the floor
\\I don't believe there's life after death
\\When you die, you re a carcass in the ground
\\I found out how painful it was to lose someone
\\Oxygen tanks allowing her to breathe
\\Morphine to keep the pain tolerable
\\Trying to not cry to show her everything is gonna be fine
\\All those tears came out in the funeral
\\Cancer killing her after 2 hours we left
\\Never expected that day to be the last time i saw her
\\Death kept coming
\\A cousin dying from unknown diabetes
\\I just didn't know what to say at this point
\\I used to deal with these turbulent thoughts with slits
\\Sometimes pain was what I wanted to be hit with
\\To lose blood to lose thoughts
\\Later I had to learn to live with it
\\Hanging onto short term memory to forget easily
\\Doubting myself because I didn't want to believe in myself anymore
\\The thing is, it made me lose faith in religion
\\I couldn't put my trust in something who won't show his father fucking lord ass
\\And answer me why she fucking died
\\She fucking prayed 
\\Was loyal to this bastard who made her die with so much pain
\\So don't you dare ask me why I can't stand religions sometimes
\\You do you
\\But don't you dare involve me in it
\\I'm never in the mood for holy bullshit
\\Turbulent thoughts is leaving me in turbulence
\\This whole world is out of balance
\\Fake bitches trying to act like your bros
\\Don't believe I fell for that shit
\\I swear because I'm insecure
\\I'm like windows
\\No matter the updates, the bugs aren't being fixed
\\No matter how hard I try
\\Some memories can't be forgotten
\\Maybe something is wrong with me
\\Probably because I got myself to be a faggot
\\Trying to act all fine
\\Making my problems into jokes
\\Now I turned my life into a circus carnival
\\May as well see tomorrow's promise right
\\To those with depression and suicidal problems
\\Start with gaining confidence in yourself
\\Don't fall with the plane
\\Fight the turbulence
\\Don't fall in your own trap
\\Stop being a pussy, stop risking your life with problems you can fix
\\People love you and sometimes it's good to be reminded of that
\\I forget as well
\\I said "You actually care about me?"
\\She said "Of course why wouldn't I"
\\Sighs fogging my eyes to see reality clear
\\Your mind is a beast that must be tamed
\\Or else you'll be a subject to it
\\So if you are currently in turbulence
\\Give yourself time and work on getting yourself happy
\\Follow your interests
\\I bet you are interesting
\\If you are having suicidal thoughts
\\Don't be a fool and ask for help
\\Don't die from your ego
\\Drop that as well
\\I learned a lot from grief
\\You have to accept life
\\And don't forget this
\\You will always be loved

\par White people....what do we say now
\\Do you want us to beg

\\White supremacist in the government
\\The Klan is very much alive
\\Members attacking innocents blacks
\\Tell that lady to shut the fuck up
\\I ain't no Egyptian terrorist
\\What the fuck
\\Trying to go to work to hear a whore shouting racist shit to everyone
\\How would you feel to work in a plantation
\\Given weapons and called a danger
\\God why are people so stupid
\\Hijabs are considered to be a symbol of terrorism
\\Okay then the cross is a symbol of violence
\\A symbol of discrimination
\\No I'm not saying that
\\For what about the others who wear a cross
\\We are impatient for change
\\Because we have been for so long
\\We have too much innocents becoming patients to this disease
\\White girls trying to act black because they're unoriginal
\\Trying so hard to get that black cock
\\So cock up that gun and kill every racist
\\No violence isn't the way
\\If we kill them how are we different from them
\\Man you ever wonder how big Trump's dick is
\\Because he sure is fucking America with it
\\I'm done with censoring this shit
\\Middle East is in chaos, America fucked it up
\\Iranian revolutions causing a nuclear feud
\\We are so deluded to this shit
\\Can we ban America?
\\No you idiot, or else the whole economy will crumble
\\But is money worth lives
\\First nations solving problems with suicide
\\Racism is everywhere
\\Not only in America
\\It's not the people
\\It's the government not doing shit about it
\\So maybe NWA was right
\\Fuck the police
\\But fuck the government
\\Do shit
\\You don't have that much time left
\\We are already impatient

\\Abuse me
\\Fucking mess me up
\\Who gives a fuck about me
\\A terrorist with no weapon
\\Who the fuck is saying that about me
\\Because I'm brown, being looked at like shit
\\So flush out the race
\\A case whites haven't looked into
\\Too busy showing the latest bombing
\\Because in America
\\Every Arab blew up the towers
\\Police are being brutal
\\Crucial in the law system
\\But showing to be corrupted like Trump
\\With all the shit happening
\\A virus affecting many
\\Police not seeing the problem with attacking race
\\Is suicide even a problem at this point
\\I rather kill myself than someone killing me
\\But I rather not see that day
\\Mental Health leaving me in mental confinement
\\Am I really free
\\If I said the truth about racism
\\Would I be listened to
\\Would they care about the who and what
\\The Klan waving crosses in fire
\\Is it getting hot in here
\\Jews into ashes
\\Blacks into slaves
\\Muslims into terrorists
\\Indigenous into savages
\\Remember how Canada's railroad was made
\\Chinese labourers, many of which died
\\White being the superior
\\That is complete horse shit
\\The church would burn a whore instead of helping
\\Tears are being wiped
\\6 million Jews were wiped
\\A number not being counted for the abused blacks
\\Mosques being shot, we pray for the dead
\\Is humanity alive anymore
\\Races locked up in their own trauma
\\Freedom not being true
\\C'mon tell me when we can all sleep
\\Let's ask the white man
\\Can we have our freedom back
\\I can't be a slave in my own mind
\\I can't be a slave to corrupted authority
\\I want the key to freedom

\\Three for the freaks revealing their true colors
\\Four for the whores fucking up this world
\\Stupid people having to listen to simple shit
\\Shouldn't shit not be taken lightly
\\Don't shorten it
\\Simpletons only being able to understand roses are red
\\How did mumble become humble and make rap crumble
\\I try to assemble all the cues
\\All the data gathering peoples mind
\\Every generation is getting shit easier
\\We are all becoming fucking stupid
\\From Pac to pump how did you lose taste to the lack of rap
\\Lack of truth in lyrics
\\A revolution turning into a joke
\\From choking a bitch to choking with one rhyme
\\Others getting into this shit
\\It starts to look black and pink in here
\\If I say fuck you
\\How you like that
\\My path is engraved in me but even I don't know its destiny
\\Fairy tales into reality
\\Myths are just reality on an expiration date
\\Our fate has came too late now we are scared for its arrival
\\Craving it, trying to watch it in Netflix but it's loading
\\We loss ourselves
\\Not too sound like a boomer but shouldn't we love physical rather than virtual
\\I'm a techy
\\But I love the physical hardware that makes up the virtual right...
\\Hypocrisy has turned into a controversy
\\It's like Alan Turing being a faggot
\\Quite sad as he could've done so much more
\\Instead drugs made him into a white girl
\\Not being able to do shit
\\Trying to get that BBC to say ni-
\\You can figure out the rest
\\A pass to say a word of past slavery
\\Pain and trauma becomes antique over time
\\The officers have become a crime
\\Yemen is experiencing gods hell
\\America what happened to fixing Afghanistan
\\Oh wait didn't you also let the Kurd's get attacked
\\So ISIS escaped
\\What the hell is going into your head
\\I wish you were the one-shot
\\Not Kennedy
\\But why does Erica love being fucked
\\From North and South
\\West versus East coast
\\Violence is your motto
\\Get rid of freedom on your logo
\\Because I have one last word to say to you
\\Fuck you!

\section{History Will Remember This}
\par From countless killings
\\To abuse of minority
\\America have you woken up
\\We've been waiting to talk to you
\\You try to end violence in different countries
\\Wait a minute
\\You cause it
\\The media covers it
\\Then you to try to end it
\\And are called the problem solvers
\\But you can't even end the violence in your own domain
\\Police are going with no name
\\Killing innocents
\\The justice system can't tell right from wrong
\\Only from white to colour
\\Is there no shame in this
\\Holy shit innocents are being locked up
\\Why because they are black
\\In the 90s they said they were part of Crips
\\Or Blood
\\But the only blood i see is not from drug dealers
\\How the fuck do we heal a traumatized race
\\You can't even face the truth
\\When people spoke as loud as they can it was silent
\\But now we are making you silent
\\So you can hear
\\Try to cover your ears
\\It won't do shit
\\Until we find the right piece to fit this puzzle
\\America we are putting a muzzle on you
\\Now I ain't no fool
\\America you ain't alone
\\Other countries exist
\\And this is for them as well
\\The minority has the majority population in earth
\\So fuck with us and don't forget
\\You may think you're superior
\\But you are not smarter than us
\\You are not stronger than us
\\You are not more dominant than us
\\All you are is an ignorant fool
\\Who ain't even human
\\So stop being an inhumane little insane bastard
\\All you are is a hazard to innocent families
\\The law is the criminal
\\So lets demolish it and start new
\\For one thing reeducate these bastards something new
\\You ain't special because of your colour
\\We ain't different because of our colour
\\We are just people trying to figure out
\\Why the fuck we living
\\So America and others get your ass up from your static seat
\\And start doing shit
\\Change is happening
\\Either you go with it
\\Or it's making you go
\\For whatever happens

\section{Corruption}
\par Men are inherently evil
\\To have a definition between right and wrong
\\Why bother defining
\\We are wrong
\\No need for a song to tell us of our long history
\\Whether it was slavery or genocide
\\We can't hide from the sins of our ancestors
\\The ignorance from others
\\Will make our utter end
\\We lend our trust to politicians
\\But the only truth in their eyes
\\Is the bribes behind their back
\\A system that can't operate without interference
\\An unfair balance to balance the scales
\\All hail the white and fuck the black
\\What the fuck is wrong is wrong with that
\\Why the fuck is that a question
\\Have we not learned a lesson from discrimination
\\Corruption is running the system
\\For those who make the rules
\\Are the one who break them
\\As the system rules us
\\Slowly killing us
\\Suicide is on my mind
\\Let me go behind that building to slit my throat
\\Or my wrists, whatever your wish
\\A fish trying to swim on land
\\Are we useless in this situation
\\No matter how loud we scream
\\All we are is silent
\\Is it me or is it getting hard to breathe
\\Do I have asthma
\\Abuse a couple of inhalers to try to feel better
\\Anxiety is keeping a hold of me
\\Why is everybody being so ignorant
\\We are suffering from the bureaucrats
\\I'm not trying to act like a communist
\\But can our comrades get some share in society
\\Abused minorities
\\Is it even worth it to argue
\\People dying from Covid
\\Whites bringing extreme protests that are troubling the black
\\How are we human
\\If we lack so much humanity
\\Heckling like an old geezer
\\Can we put time in a freezer it's obviously heating up
\\Freeze time to let it cool down
\\Problems being so hard to overcome
\\As if it was as simple as jacking it off
\\This year is getting harder to handle
\\Every month is a new reaction to this erection
\\Politicians goddamn do something
\\Before we charge you with murder
\\Fucking corrupted bastards
\\The system is fucking us
\\We are the sister and its our brother
\\It's not right
\\I protest against this incest
\\People traumatized by violence
\\No one can rest
\\No one is ready for this test
\\We had time to prepare
\\But now we are cramming
\\Sars, and Ebola aren't those the warnings
\\To prepare for this virus
\\Didn't Tupac talk about the deaths on the street
\\Fuck the police about the corruption of police
\\Why is everyone deaf
\\No one is listening
\\For if I die from this stupidity
\\Damn those to hell
\\They can't tell the difference between right and wrong
\\Corruption plagues our mind
\\Suicide will be in everyone's mind
\\All soon to ride the same bicycle
\\Riding off course
\\From a bicycle on a path to an airplane in turbulence
\\We are in turbulent troubles
\\Fumbles as we mumble our prayers
\\We are players in this bullshit game
\\No shame in reckless actions
\\Before we lose
\\I ask
\\If they listened
\\Would we be in this situation
\\Is corruption a necessity
\\For humanity isn't a utopia
\\So before we live in a dystopia
\\Maybe if we listened
\\We would be the winners in this game we play

\\Death is something we wish to not think of
\\So why see it
\\Fucking shit why won't you listen to me
\\Don't kill innocents
\\We smell sulfur before it hits
\\What would I know about war
\\Hell my nation is always ready for war
\\A border made by the white
\\Separated without our say
\\British better shut the fuck up before we knock those wretched teeth out
\\People underestimate racism's effect
\\If you would like to know ask the black
\\Hell a virus comes out and the Chinese think they are a victim of everything
\\Shut up you haven't experienced shit
\\All you do is attack each other
\\Has your mosque been shot?
\\Arabs hate each other
\\Pakis and India hate each other

\\Saudi royals trying to get as much wives to fuck

\\Sorry forever isn't a number
\\And I like numbers
\\Fuckers are lucking their path
\\Turbulent thoughts are getting them off course
\\Of course we are one of the victims
\\Depression hits them
\\Anxiety fuels it
\\Shit is shaking, getting shady is it getting hazy over here

\\Lets be lustful like lesbians
\\Because being a faggot isn't much to hag for
\\Lets nag as we go gag
\\Mind is swirling as we go around dancing
\\What the fuck are we doing
\\We are grieving as we are ready to be leaving this world
\\God are you worried your children are slitting
\\Isn't it fitting since you don't give a shit about them
\\Shouting unleashing hell on them
\\Fuck them
\\As all they want to do is fuck each other
\\Sex is on guys minds
\\Premade monsters
\\Curiosity leads to rapists
\\Therapists diagnosing them with masculinity
\\So what about female rapists
\\Goddamn Karen's can't answer that question
\\Lets learn a lesson from human stupidity
\\We think we are so smart
\\But common sense is the common stupidity we all share
\\Where are my manners did I call you stupid
\\Fill that mouth of yours with gasoline fuel
\\Flick the lighter and watch it burn ya
\\Explosions combusting as we are cussing
\\We all go through compulsions
\\Wake up to realize all of this is a breakdown
\\Arguing with one's self
\\Made up arguments
\\Lessons that were never made
\\Our theoretical mind isn't being practical
\\Lets be factual because we are actually suffering
\\Too ignorant to ask for help
\\This is what turbulent thoughts are
\\A breakdown of mood swings
\\So let me give you advice when turbulent thoughts occur
\\If you think about... 
\\Tomorrow's promise 
\\Depression
\\That no one loves you
\\Then shut the fuck up
\\Go to somebody you trust and say
\\I need help, can you help
