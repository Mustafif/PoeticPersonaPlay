\section{Epiphany}
My mind is in an epiphany
\\I'm trying to understand what it means
\\The astrals are trying to align the stars
\\I'm getting a telescope
\\Writing down the details
\\Trying to solve this mystery I'm stuck in
\\Now this epiphany is all I can think about
\\I venture this journey it presents me
\\The journey begins with this epiphany
\\If I'm supposed to finish my goal
\\This epiphany is to show me the path the light glows
%
\\\\My mind is in an epiphany
\\I'm trying to understand what it means
\\Now it's all I can think about
\\Whether it's the decision
\\Or the uncertainty that's trying to make me decide
\\I'm not ready to wear my big boy shoes
\\But I have to take responsibility
\\So we break some rules around the no no of my poetry
\\Let's explore poetry
\\The beauty and ugly
\\Whatever its form
\\It will be found in the epiphany of my poetry 
\newpage
\chapter{The Unspoken}
The Unspoken...we shall not talk about details or what entails in the beast within. 
We say, what else is there to speak about, what's next that's coming from my mouth, do we dare speak of the 
anger that's bursting out, cunts are making line cuts that are unfair to the rest of us, now we shall speak 
but in a lower volume, because we are the lower volume, whisper not shout, but in the unspoken we shout until 
we are heard from.  
\newpage
\section{Almost Left}
I almost left because poems weren't coming in my mind
\\I couldn't see myself put the pencil on the paper
\\A worn down pencil
\\I'm trying to think of the next word
\\And the next word is thinking of me
\\A feedback loop
\\It's going back and forth until we both give up
\\I want to say fuck it
\\But poetry had become too important to leave
\\Put the rhymes in my head
\\Now I'm asking what's there left to say
\\I don't want to get stuck on stupid mother fuckers
\\Or the bigotry that I find in human beings
\\We all lossed our sense of direction
\\And now we are all drifting away
\\I almost left
\\But the epiphany caught me
\\A second of doubt
\\Second guessing myself
\\I almost left
\\But I'm getting better than ever 
\newpage
\section{I'm Back}
I'm back because I had an epiphany
\\Decided poetry was a defining moment
\\Now I'm here to talk about the cunts in life
\\A poet with twists in his poems
\\I'm flexible about how personal this gets
\\It's like the noose I'm setting up
\\People are so stupid
\\When it comes to the stupid genius
\\I'm just a fucking genius
\\So all I ask is for you to shut the fuck up
\\Suck on a dick and drool
\\Let me hang once and for all
%
\\\\People think it's cool to be a fool
\\But nevermind about that
\\They're too into themselves to listen
\\They're fingering their own mind
\\If it's a guy all he's thinking about is vaginas
\\I'm back because taking a break was too boring
\\Sharp point in my mind
\\I couldn't describe these faggots with their side hoes
\\You're gayer than me
\\Burn in hell
\\Shut the fuck up
\\And go fuck yourself
%
\\\\Your opinion doesn't matter to me
\\You're just a spoiled brat angry I don't give shits of my say 
\\Just suck on my dick and swallow the truth
\\It's white and sticky
\\You fucking sperm accident
\\You're really pissing me off
\\Your presence wants me to cut myself...
\\Play tick tack toe with my wrist
\\Turn it around
\\Get the vein and become a vampire
\\Suck the blood out
\\Fall out unconscious
\\Find me dead on the floor
\\Your stupidity is killing me
\\Wear a mask so I don't even need to see you
\\I'm back with poems with personality
\\Wait in line to hear my epiphany 
\newpage
\section{No Censor}
If you don't like what I got to say
\\Shut the fuck up
\\Put the book down and don't come to me
\\I don't need your ideas meddling with mine
\\I don't need my mind being fucked with you
\\No sex without consent and I say...
\\No!
\\No censors because that's just more fun
\\We aren't going to talk about my bisexual problems
\\Sexuality getting complicated when you start to like the others
\\When it comes to sex you ask who fucks who?
\\Me and You? Suck, fuck and get in the bed
\\Vaginas and dicks becoming one
\\A key and a gate
\\Two wires connecting
\\Any other references of genatelia
\\This virgin is amused with his wild imagination
\\Wet dreams are getting into sticky situations
\\Puberty giving teens an introduction to horniness
\\There's a MILF near me?
\\Is she a slut or expressing herself?
\\When you see that girl walk by
\\Look at her beautiful smile
\\Not her ass or breasts
\\Hide your dick before the erection starts poking out
\\It's like Pinocchio's nose coming out
\\Its awkward when people notice
\\Make sure to have that binder that blocks it away
\\Or those tough jeans
\\Be careful, you're a guy
\\A premade predator
\\You don't have feelings people care about
\\We suffer because we say I'm okay
\\I can't lie
\\But I'm fucking suffering with this depression
\\Its caught me on a hook
\\It won't let go and its dragging me across the floor
\\It's casting a spell and now I'm suicidal
\\Dealing with problems as a faggot
\\Slitting until blood isn't able to come out
\\Pass out, going to the hospital
\\That all happened in my dream before school
\\Let's be more mature to the truth
\\No censors to the enforce a barrier of recovery
\\Don't lie, amuse me with the honesty 
\newpage
\section{Counter Decisions}
For all those haters, fuck you!
\\And all those ignorant fools, fuck you too
%
\\\\Little snitches talking shit of the wrong idea
\\Fucking bitches couldn't understand such a simple idea
%
\\\\You're going to hell with me
\\Because of the blind eye that couldn't see
\\Let me get you glasses
\\Your mind and eyes aren't working properly
%
\\\\Y'all motherfuckers didn't care about the problems
\\The ones I layed out because I felt we could solve them
\\You gave me the hate and thought badly of me
\\How was I supposed to believe this shit
\\It didn't fit
\\I presented it
\\What was the wrong in that
\\How? How did you call me them
%
\\\\Fuckers accused me of fucked up things
\\Still trying to figure this shit out
\\I'm sorry but this still stings
\\A bee's stinger impaled in me
\\My heart is beating faster as the anxiety took over
\\I spent so long that as it slowed
\\I felt I was dying
%
\\\\I mean someone had to speak right
\\I had the right sight
\\So happy you left
\\Y'all turned into waste ghetto bitches
\\So let me talk about my opinions
\\Or get out
\\Rape is affecting teens our age
\\Putting them a cage of paranoia they can't escape
\\As teen pregnancy arises
\\Suicide rates can't even go low
\\Teens dying from overdose
\\Being stupid and death coming close
\\Drinking parties bringing more vodka
\\Taking more shots of Tequila
%
\\\\They don't think of the Counter-Decisions
\\Actions not being questioned
\\Reputations being tainted
%
\\\\Can I complain anymore?
\\That people are going insane for what?
\\For a couple more shots
\\Getting high in the parking lot
\\Or getting caught
%
\\\\I'm not wrong
\\It just happened...
\\I chose the wrong time to sing my song 
\newpage
\section{The Living Hell}
Our world only has one thought
\\Fought with principles brought by society
\\This hierarchy deems us not worthy
\\Not worthy enjoy life as it is
\\This stress us getting to me
\\All I can see is the work piling
\\Crying inside....
\\This shit ain't worth the fucking pain
\\I will complain how much it hurts
\\It hurts so badly
\\My mind is spiralling
\\I'm trying to think but now it turns around
\\What is thinking thinking of me
\\My mind has become a beacon of questions
\\I'm in my own mental confinement
\\Begging for mercy
\\I'm so thirsty for peace in this fucking life
\\The strife I strive on is a bitch
\\After all the cuts I'll have stitch me up and shoot me
\\Let me see the hell I belong to
\\Is it too soon to see what I deserve
\\Is it reserved to be given later
\\I'm curious and drooling for answers
\\I'm a hater of my sins
\\It hinges in me for eternity
\\I have the ability to change
\\But I'm staying static to these situations
\\It will not change the sins I've committed
\\So maybe this is why hell has fitted me so well
\\So tell me, is this the living hell we call life? 
\newpage
\section{Writer's Block}
Fuck it here we are again
\\I can't think of anything offensive I can justify
\\I can no longer satisfy my desires
\\Writing poems are feeling like retirement
\\It's to compensate for this lonely heart
\\But I don't really have anything else to say
\\Poems are getting harder to write
\\Trying to squeeze out that last bit out of ideas
\\I have no more ideas in sight
\\I don't have any more mental fights
\\I don't got anything to say about her
\\I still love her
\\I always did, it just took me a while to understand
\\I smile writing that
\\In fact being happy is pretty stressful
\\I have too much stuff to enjoy
\\But not enough time in a day to do it
\\I just love doing art shows
\\Arts really do matter
\\Creativity is pressured on
\\Found out and immediately monetized
\\But I don't want to digress no more
\\I can't write like I used to
\\The Classics are leaving my mind
\\I look back and think about this
\\Maybe it's time for me to stop
\\I might leave
\\Sorry but I'm in writer's block 
\newpage
\section{Stuck}
I'm stuck in a bind that collapses me
\\I only have a crack to see, A little bit to peep
\\But too small to reach
\\I can no longer preach of my situation
\\To start off I have a confession...
%
\\\\I'm scared, Acting confident but really a paranoid idiot
\\I'm scared if you are really friends with me
\\Or the coping method I portray myself as
\\I know I shouldn't ask
\\But I don't want to lose you guys
\\My sighs are becoming as loud as my heartrate
\\It keeps getting louder to me
\\Is my fate to doubt reality?
\\I couldn't remember when I felt sure about something
\\Doubt clouding decisions I'm yet to decide
\\Complexity has become my simplicity
\\Simplicity has become my complexity
\\How can I rationalize this mess I'm given
\\I'm stuck in society's stress
\\I have too much of a different perspective
\\I'm ready to go to heaven
\\I'm 70 in my memory and it's all gone temporary
\\I want to say sorry
\\I'm regretting all my mistakes
\\All of them in which I should've learned from
\\I had no reason to be mad at you
\\I was foolish fogged in my selfish pursuits
\\I want to say see you soon
\\But that has become doubt as well
\\I don't want to lose our friendship
\\Or then I'll be lost forever
\\Not knowing what else to do if I lose it
\\But I think I'm starting to lose it
\\Shit I know I'm complicated
\\Troubled by constant turbulence
\\I'm sorry but I may be addicted to my pain
\\I need first aid to help with this wound in me
\\I'm still stuck, I've lost feeling to my limbs
\\They're no longer part of me
\\I wonder if I leave
\\Will I still be a part of your life
\\Or a forgotten memory
\\My feet is bleeding, muscles gushing blood
\\Fuck I don't know what to do
\\I don't want to ask for help again
\\I don't want to worry you
\\I don't want to bother you of the usual
\\I'm ordering my regular
\\The one I always seem to get
\\Nothing changing my constant lies
\\I want to shout at you
\\To release all my anger
\\But it's my fault
\\Maybe I just need a hug
\\Because I'm scared of the future
\\I can't be honest of how I'm feeling
\\This coping personality tells me nothing is wrong
\\But it is
\\I'm depressed, scared and paranoid to the bone
\\Please help me
\\Before I forget I'm stuck
\newpage
\section{What's There to Enjoy}
I have strong ideologies
\\My thoughts are leading them
\\But it doesn't fit with society's chemistry
\\I'm considered a genius
\\Sometimes it's against me because I'm not serious
\\So call me the Stupid Genius
%
\\\\But who gave you the right to disrespect
\\A fucking pain in my ass
\\Have I not given you my respect?
\\The M-U-S-T-A-F-I-F
\\Don't be a dumbass and take it back
%
\\\\Why is it so bad to be good at math
\\I can calculate how many words I need
\\To fucking insult you to leave me
\\So don't talk the shit that's bullshit
%
\\So who gives a fuck
\\I'll be ahead of the clock
\\See you later sucker!
\\I don't need to have fun in class
\\That's what after class is meant for
\\Leave me to be focused
\\Some of us really have plans in our future
%
\\\\Do you see the sand in the glass
\\I'm at the top using my time
\\You're at the bottom burying in it
\\Don't even try to speak
\\Your argument is mine
%
\\\\Okay I'll admit this Stupid Genius is pretty smart
\\That's why understanding society's logic is hard
%
\\\\What's there to enjoy
\\When people don't like this genius in me
\\They don't even try to see
\\I had no meaning for harm to be inclined
\newpage
\section{Mustafif Rewrite}
How come I am asked
\\Interrogated as I'm chained to the seat
\\Tell me the answers you faggot
\\Tell me the secrets that incarcerate you
\\What's leaving you in mental confinement
%
\\\\How come they can't leave me be
\\I ask for silence
\\I'm done with the talking
\\Leave me with my emotions
\\Let us settle this naturally
\\But now you're trying to rush the process
\\Now I can't process what's happening
\\What's going on
\\Confused and still no answers going on
%
\\\\Yeah I'm Mustafif
\\The MK of Poetry
\\The Stupid Genius
\\I have the Poetic Personas writing my emotions
\\They're telling me what to say
\\My hand keeps going on and on
\\Telling stories I was scared to share
\\Now it's public to the public
%
\\\\My name means respect
\\So I deliver that before my shit hits
\\I'm a Khan
\\A natural leader
\\So I appoint me to lead you out of suicide
\\A terrible storm, I'll be your captain
\\A Brown person that means I'm in suspect
\\Whether the fact I know math well
\\Or my interest in technology
\\In the American eyes that means I'm making a bomb
\\A will made out of steel
\\It's hard to steal happiness from me
\\When I'm blowing up your expectations
\\Shut the fuck and let me speak
\\I didn't ask to be a genius
\\Naturally smarter than you
\\I grew up becoming more mature
\\But I couldn't be sure
\\Don't want to take the serious stuff too serious
\\I'm spending all my energy trying to get my point across
\\Now I'm struggling myself to the other side
\\I'm tired
\\Struggling to get myself up
\\The broken plane unable to fly
\\I am casted under a slumber I am unable to wake from
\\I need a reason to wake up
\\But nothing comes to reason
\\Then an epiphany comes to my mind
\\I ask what does it mean
\\But all it does it awakens the eyes of a poet
\\It's not over until I say so
\\It couldn't
\\It shouldn't
\\It's because I'm a clever fucker
%
\\\\I want so much
\\My life can't be over yet
\\Too much in stakes for the future
\\Tomorrow's promise will have to wait later
\\I have plans tomorrow
\\Maybe it's with a girl I've fallen in love to
\\Or its something new
\\The future is infinite to the finite mind
%
\\\\How can a nerd have emotions?
\\I cry as my heart is lost in oceans
\\In this vast location is there anyone for this fool
\\I sigh asking what's next
\\Would it be time to quit as ideas start disappearing
\\I appear ungrateful for all that I have
\\I hear voices in my head...
\\Be faithful
\\If I tried...I just couldn't
\\Be happy as I sit here alone
%
\\\\But you have so many people who care about you?
\\All I do is worry them
\\Do I say bye to leave the stress?
\\Or forget my plan
\\I couldn't decide as I forgot all I learned
\\Mood swings making emotions a pendulum
\\They have no clue of what's happening
\\A mess
\\The Beast in Beauty and the Beast
\\Mustafif come back to us
\\You're okay
\\I'M GOING INSANE
\\Chains locking me
\\I'm trying to escape but they're holding me
\\I'm trying to control myself
\\Self-control being less of an option
\\The world is turning grey
\\Eyes going red with tears welling out of it
\\Tunnel vision leaving me dizzy
\\My mind is going fizzy with memory
\\Bits of me start to disappear 
%
\\\\My mind comes back with voices
\\Take a rest!
\\Go on a break!
%
\\\\But I can't
\\They need me
\\Do they?
\\I need to be there
\\Well consider the counter decisions
\\I consider all of what I've done
\\Would I tell her anything if I left
\\Yet another poem figuring it out with her
\\I'm sorry
\\I won't be able to be your friend forever
\\My mind is coming up with excuses
\\But I just want to tell you something
\\Thank you for teaching me love
\\Without you I don't know where I'd be
\\You will always be in my heart
\\You'll always drive me crazy
\\But in the end, leave me happy
\\Thank you for letting me have a sister
\\An empty hole inside me
\\A void I thought couldn't be filled
\\So when I leave
\\Don't cry
\\I'll come back
\\I'll say hi
\\You have many adventures left
\\I won't be able to help you
\\You're smart, remember that
\\Someone my intelligence is jealous of
\\There are many great things about you
\\My list can go on forever
\\But to me
\\I'll always remember you as the cute girl
\\That made my world go into colours 
\newpage
\section{Fake Bitch Rewrite}
I trusted you
\\And you were nothing but a snake
\\I'm a Grifferin
\\And you're a slithering Slytherin
\\No magic here except your tricks
\\You're making me sick and I don't want to be a dick
\\I want to say frick but I have a dick so I'll say
\\Fuck you fake bitch
\\You're nothing but an error in my memory
\\A bad one in my good days
\\So I'll stay away from you
\\For all the years I knew you didn't exist
\\Who the fuck was that person
\\What would I have said to you instead of nothing
\\Probably fuck you little cunt
\\Something in that line
%
\\\\You don't know love
\\If your love is only using someone
\\You don't know yourself
\\If you act like someone else
\\Having a big ego is drinking poison everyday
\\Your mind is warped into its own existence
\\You think you're better than others
\\Typical white behaviour right?
\\Shit not to offend you for being a colonists
\\But you kind of are
\\But I ain't land
\\I'm not a little slave in a plantation
\\I'm a person saying fuck you
%
\\\\The fact I regretted my action towards you
\\Haha funny
\\I apologized to those that I really needed to
\\I didnt know what happened with my mind
\\The mind itself isn't kind
\\A beast to be tamed
\\But I can write a book about this
\\Call it counter decisions
\\Its about our non existent friendship
\\I act nice to live up to my name
\\But I dont need to live up to you
\\So for all those fake bitches
\\Fuck you
\\You got no audience after highschool
\\So be my guest continue being a fool
\\It'll be funny seeing a sucker ruining their life
\\So they know the pain they dealt me
\\I would never help you
\\I would never talk to you
\\You're gluten to my stomach
\\I can't fucking tolerate you

\newpage 
\section{5 Minutes}
I'm a boy so I'm toyed with the idea of sex 
\\Men think about it every 5 minutes 
\\So as we discuss the Afghan wars 
\\The women are thinking about the problem 
\\As the man are thinking about Afghan titties 
\\As we have little attention spans 
\\We can't help ourselves 
\\Shit any person can be a rapists, 
\\If they are trained in a retarted way 
\\Studies intesively in porno
\\Get him away from his step sister 
\\OH NO
\\Lolies are saying no
\\Consent is saying no 
\\But he says yes, and apparently that's all that matters
\\In 5 minutes maybe the girl could've been saved
\\In 5 minutes maybe the guy wouldn't have thought about his acts
\\If we didn't act like it was all right 
\\If the American politicians are saying it's gods plan
\\Keep the child that was never supposed to be in womb
\\What the fuck is wrong with society
\\We are trying to get everything all right 
\\But we aren't charging those making it static 
\\So let's stick with dealing with politics in latin 
\\Let's give them 300 seconds to think about it 
\\The boomers are thinking about how the girls trying to change it should be the kitchen 
\\So let's chill and talk this out 
\\You know what fuck it 
\\FUCK YOU
\\Treat girls with respect if you have something to say 
\\I will wait the day you die 
\\So we can actually have progress in laws
\\Make females truly equal
\\Work like mongolians 
\\Unisex instead of favouring sex
\\The problem is you didn't even listen to me
\\You were thinking like a pervert
\\Why care about genitals 
\\When you care thinking about something as pretty
\\Their smiles
\\It warms your heart, loving seeing them happy
\\I would love to spend 5 minutes ranting about these inequalities 
\\Spend 10 minutes getting rid of the word simp 
\\Because it's simply fucking stupid 
\\If I respect women, sorry I'm just a fucking human being
\\If you ain't doing that
\\What the fuck are you
\\So before you say simp
\\Think about what you're about to say
\\Before I lecture the shit out of you that day
\\Rap was charged with objectifying women 
\\So instead I'll talk about the greats and worsts among them 
\\I would not call a girl a bitch 
\\Unless she did shit that I couldn't handle
\\I say to really appreciate a girl
\\Don't spend 5 minutes thinking about fucking shit 
\\Spend it thinking about how great she is
\\Because trust me 
\\A girl's personality 
\\Is the most beautiful thing you'll ever see

\newpage 
\section{Ego}
Let's talk about ego, a building block in popularity 
\\A word we confuse with dignity 
\\So let's talk about the severity of this complexity of a three lettered word 
\\We go 101, 103, 111
\\How would you understand when my lines are going into integers 
\\So how could you feel my words when you're too into yourself 
\\So get that dick outside of your mind and listen 
\\Egos are cracking eggs but that egg is dripping legos 
\\It's building when you crack it, as it cracking you up with ideas 
\\So you're high with thoughts that aren't yours 
\\But who else is in your mind so it's yours 
\\Hah idiots 
\\Subconciously you're getting taken 
\\So let me talk about ego 
\\A whore fucking you constantly 
\\But it pleasures you so you go along 
\\Stop but continue
\\What a weakling 
\\To be happy is to let go of this ego
\\Let it go 
\\But you ain't listening to Elsa, you're listening to Jean 
\\So you continue doing this shit 
\\How can I get this in your head when you barely control it 
\\Fit this info to your hippocampus 
\\Fucking dumbass hippo
\\"Oh my god I'm just so amazing, no one else is better than me"
\\What a fucking bitch 
\\You barely know shit, and everyone is good in their o-
\\God why even try right 
\\We have a mind and we are overwhelmed so we rather fuck ourselves 
\\So let me talk about egos 
\\I'm trying to count all the impaired thoughts 
\\May as well be retarted right
\\That might have gone out wrong 
\\What I mean is don't be as narrow minded
\\Don't make yourself stuck in a long hall
\\So stop stalling and let it go
\\Every ego is living it's own existence 
\\Living a prince charming in an enchanted forest 
\\And it all ends with you being the saddest fucking villian

\newpage 
\section{Illusions}
Illusions are confusing the psyche 
\\Memories are getting shaky as it's starting to get foggy
\\Are we imagining or are we imagining we are imagining 
\\We are getting vigilant with our thoughts as it's haunting our decisions 
\\Self doubt is doubting ourselves
\\Comprimise with our inner demon to be set free
\\But it's a backwards deal and we set it free
\\Our illusions are fusing with our reality 
\\We are having network issues as we can't connect back
\\No route to host 
\\We are an error to ourselves 
\\Shit 
\\We try to fit excuses into therapy sessions 
\\Depression is a rising topic as suicide made it's turn 
\\Confidential going to mental hospitals 
\\An asylum is where you belong you mental danger 
\\We isolate you with your thoughts so suicide can take over
\\You'll finally see Hovi
\\Illusions are encapsulating you as you are encapulated 
\\Manipulated of your own doing to spitting in your own food 
\\Crueled in your own torture 
\\What is a dream without a nightmare?
\newpage
\section{Faggot}
I'm a fucking faggot
\\Stuck in my closet
\\Because words should stay in my mouth
\\It's where they belong
\\Coming out comes with consequences I'm not ready for .
\\So now I'm here sitting all alone
%
\\\\A fucking faggot
\\Instead of liking girls
\\I chose boys as well
\\I'm sorry but pussies weren't enough for me to be attracted to
\\Not a choice when years spent me questioning
\\I mean I already acted gay so why not be a faggot
\\I'm saying this with no confidence because I'm in a tight situation
\\A little peep will fuck me up
\\It's like being stuck with a school shooter
\\Or a police officer and I'm black
\\Ah shit....if I speak I'm dead
\\A fucking faggot stuck in the closet
\\I mean its cozy after a while
\\So leave me
\\Leave me in my closet
\\Until I'm ready to leave and say a word 
\newpage

\textit{\%Skit Begin}
\\Rapist: Oh fuck yeah, oh yeah!
\\Guy: Hey what the fuck is happening!
\\Rapist: Hey I'm just fucking this bitch right here!

\\HIV in the mix
\\Who knows what shit that dick had with it
%
\\\\Bitches are calling her a whore 
\\They don't know her story, they don't know shit
\\They don't know she was fucking helpless
\\A situation she wasn't even aware of 
\\Not even the law protecting her 
\\They said, "It's all your fault so fuck you!"
\\All she wanted was to feel love 
\\All she wanted was to go out with this guy
\\Pill slipped in her drink
\\Feeling woozy drowsy and waking up the evening of tomorrow 
\\Clothes ripped to shreds leading to her pussy
\\Oh fuck!

\\\\\textit{Ma'am I'm sorry but unconcious rape in California is non-violence}

\\Republicans making laws so they can have little girls in their closets 
\\The rapist getting a chance to talk about the situation of the child
\\Man this is so hard to write, the pain I'm feeling imagining this 
\\Sick thinking about not being able to show the distress
\\It's exponentially lower than what will happen 
\\Crying these tears for someone invaded without knowing 
\\A predator hunting a helpless prey
\\File a divorce from this stupid country
%
\\\\Come to Canada where rape is rape
\\A fucking crime invading, what consent 
\\America doesn't ask for consent 
\\Fighting in Vietnam with no one's knowledge 
\\My Lai Massacre, don't forget about the tragedy
\\Tragedy called America being involved 
\\America, tell me if you let this law be passed 
\\Split your people, in racial injustice, and feminist justice 
\\Will you give them justice 
\\A women shouldn't be ignored if she is rape unconscious
\\A guy trying to help her 
\\The man charged with violence 
\\Not rape, but rape should be considered sexual violence 
\\An invasion of a person 
\\A politician wanting an excuse to fuck his secretary as she sleeps
\\Wanted an excuse he isn't a rapists
\\Doing nothing violent 
\\Non-violence is becoming a sexual violent conversation
\\So start fucking listening

\chapter{The Poetic Personas}
The Poetic Personas are getting emotions twisted in a bundled, compressed sent to different locations, 
is it me or is this making me nervous. We ask the voices where is their origins, we think  a craziness 
has overcame us, but now we are stuck thinking instead of doing anything, the Poetic Personas is here to 
answer or make more questions, about what you may ask, well that's where we both are wondering.

\section{Poetic Personas}
\%Skit Begin
\\Happiness: Look at the bright side we are all United during these troubling times
%
\\Sadness: We are here to remember that all of us will always be alone
%
\\Anger: Fucking bitches are speaking with no right, and yet we speak and they only hear a whisper
\\\%Skit End
%
\\\\Voices in my head with different views
\\I'm hurled through this time
\\It's turbulent troubles
\\A mood swing
\\A mental breakdown
\\Mental health has been issued a warning here
\\If there's a cut then get him in the emergency room
\\The Poetic Personas seeming like inside out
\\Emotions in a control room
\\But in reality we are going insane
\\Voices choices leading us to wonder what's reality
\\I'm confused and alter egos are speaking
%
\\\\The Stupid Genius is here to present his predicament
\\This bigotry is leading people to ignore authority
\\They're sick of this sickness closing us
\\But it'll only lead them to make rules tougher
\\Harder like that dick in quarantine
\\Haha we talk about how we are all here together
\\But people still can't understand the difference
\\People are getting more selfish by the second
\\Stop talking jokes you stuff in your mind
\\Reality is just a big plague
\\People are dying from it everyday
%
\\I think you've said enough
\\Goddamn anger has taken over everything
\\When cunts leave stitches
\\They're just a bitch we gotta deal with
\\Speaking nonsense
\\Not minding their own business
\\Oh wait they can't even own their business
\\They're too irresponsible
\\Make sure they wear condoms
\\We don't need anymore here
%
\\\\So anyways...
\\We get off topic because we always try to avoid it
\\Poetry became self-therapy after I wrote I'm okay
\\Because I kept asking myself
\\Then I got a chair
\\Then the Doc came to ask me
%
\\\\\%Skit Begin
\\T: Mustafif are you okay?
\\M: I want to tell you I'm okay, but I can't lie, I'm confused as hell and I don't know why?
\\T: Speak in riddles and it'll get you, remember I'm just a figment, if you don't know, so don't I
\\\%Skit End
%
\\\\I ask questions I don't know myself
\\To outsource others opinion
\\Is something I don't dare consider
\\I stay isolated within myself
\\I stay rather clever
\\The Poetic Personas are leaving me to think
\\Leaving me to think....
\\To think about how many characters
\\Characters I use to show different versions of me
\\I only ask
\\If I changed how would I be viewed
\\We are at the critical moment where we ask
\\Where life skews us to be brewed
\\We are a pawn in this large game
\\We win and lose and sometimes get our own ties
\\We try to talk about destiny and fate
\\But it's all just bullshit on a string
\\A pessimist in his natural habitat
\\I ask with all these different versions
\\Who am I really
\\The Stupid Genius
\\Or my other Alter Egos
\\Doc who always tries to help others using riddles
\\A situational combination
\\So many questions
\\And so many answers surrounding them
\\The Poetic Personas true question is
\\Who is the person behind the mask being portrayed as
